  <h2>My MIT Fullstack Developer Bootcamp</h2>
  <p>My name is Tony Anamege. I am a student at the MIT Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp.

The purpose of this short video is to introduce myself and some of the projects I have worked on so far during this Coding Bootcamp. At the moment, I have completed three projects â€“ all of which have been published on GitHub and Git-Pages.

The first is the Eye movement exercise. The coding exercises enabled me to demonstrate my level of competence in programming languages such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I was able to use the mentioned programming languages to create an eye movement website that tracks an eye motion mimicking the direction of the cursor.  I also created a site that tracks bus routes between MIT and Harvard University in real-time.

My third published project is the PacMen motion exercise. This project also involved applying JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Some of the JavaScript coding proficiencies demonstrated in this project included checkPageBounds, setIntervals, and setTimeOuts. 

I hope you find the demonstrated skills to be decent. 

Thanks for visiting.
